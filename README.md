# TXRP
Text Replaace

This is a proof of concept for CUMD (Project in planning).

Given a style.txt file that contains keys modifiers and values you can replace all instances of them in input.txt.

Example:  
`$ txrp style.txt input.txt`
Will output `output.txt`

[Style](./style.txt)  
[Input](./input.txt)  
[Output](./output.txt)
